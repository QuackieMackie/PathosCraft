PathosCraft Mod
=======

Welcome to the PathosCraft mod, a passion project being developed for Minecraft version 1.21.1 using NeoForge.

## Project Overview
PathosCraft is meant to completely transform the vanilla experience by adding new layers of gameplay.

### Future Features
These are a few things I plan on adding into this mod.
- **Magic Items**: Ranging from new resources, all the way to gameplay changing weapons
- **Unique Abilities**: Magical abilities that offer new combat tactics, exploration methods, and utility options.
- **Quests**: Quest chains that unlock abilities or items.
- **Lore**: Lore behind the world. I want to bring the game to life by creating a story. The world you created isn't just a world, I want it to feel like a home.
- **Extra Dimensions**: New realms!
  - **Central City**: A realm that houses a massive city, home to many NPCs that can be interacted with and who offer quests and rewards.
  - **Dungeons**: Dark dungeons that offer exciting rewards but intense challenges.
  - **And many more...**
- **Villages and NPCs**: NPCs, each with their own stories and quests.
- **Currency System**: In-game currency to trade and interact with NPCs and unique vendors.
- **Entities**: New and quirky monsters or friends who can keep you company on your journey or hinder it.
- **Bosses**: Challenging bosses that force you to bring your full might to battle it. 
- **Mini-Games**: Fun mini-games tied to core and custom gameplay mechanics:
  - **Fishing**: A sequence-based challenge where players follow a series of prompts on-screen in the correct order to reel in their catch, and possibly bonus rewards. The sequence grows longer and more complex as the game progresses, rewarding players who can react quickly and accurately under pressure.
  - **Lumbering**: *(N/A – Undecided)*
  - **Excavation**: The Mining Mini-Game turns basic mining into a fun and engaging challenge! Players are presented with a 5x5 grid filled randomly with ores and stones. Using a pickaxe, players have to excavate tiles, hunting for ores while trying to avoid running out of lives. Unique rewards are given based on performance, with better rewards for finding more ores. Every move counts, so strategize carefully!
  - **Farming**: *(N/A – Undecided)*
  - **And More...**

I'm using this project to teach myself Java, and because I was curious how far I can take this vision.
